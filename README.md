# AD-18 CPU Design Project


## Overview

Welcome to the AD-18 CPU Design Project! This project showcases the design and implementation of a sophisticated 18-bit Central Processing Unit (CPU) named AD-18. The CPU is meticulously crafted with a memory configuration of 8KB*18, featuring 8192 words—each 18 bits long.

## Key Features

- **18-bit Architecture:** The AD-18 CPU is designed with an 18-bit architecture, providing a balance between performance and efficiency.

- **Memory Configuration:** A memory size of 8KB with 18-bit word size, offering ample space for program storage and data manipulation.

- **Instruction Format:** The instruction format includes 13 bits for address selection, 4 bits for opcode, and 1 bit for addressing modes.


## Getting Started

To explore and run the AD-18 CPU simulation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dipenkhatri7/18-Bit-CPU-Design-Logisim.git

## Install Logisim

1. **Download and Install Logisim:**

   Download and install Logisim from the [Logisim Website](https://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

## Open the Project in Logisim

1. **Launch Logisim:**

   Open Logisim on your computer.

2. **Open the AD-18 Project File:**

   Navigate to the location where you have the AD-18 project, and open .circ file in Logisim.

## Run the Simulation

Explore the CPU design, execute instructions, and observe the simulation results.

## Project Report & Simulation Details

In the cloned folder, you'll find detailed information about the manual simulation process, including the fetching and execution of instructions in the pdf file.
